This is a remake of my first github project. It is a program that will allow you to generate random maps and challenges from a list for use with the game Black Ops 3 Zombies.
Each challenge has descriptions, rules, and a correspoding name. You may also randomize the perks you can use. The star feature of this program is the bingo board, hence the name.
In zombies bingo a bingo board will be generated with smaller challenges (compared to the main ones) to do filling each space and a bingo type to go for at the top. 
You can click on spaces to mark or unmark them and the game will award you a win every time you complete a bingo board. This score is kept even after closing the program,
allowing you to see how many times you've won at zombies bingo. Through the program you can edit everything that you want, maps, challenges, perks, descriptions, rules, and even
the bingo board challenges. Allowing for you to have ultimate customization of your zombies bingo experience. The program comes with many preloaded maps, challenges, etc, however
you may remove or add them as you wish.

/*Attention Professor McCullen! Almost none of what's in this readme is implemented yet! I wanted a project to work on over the summer so i planned a very large project. The current program should do enough to count for the final project.*/
